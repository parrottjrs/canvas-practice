# canvas-practice

During my downtime while working on [Totes McNotes](https://github.com/parrottjrs/totes-mcnotes), I discovered html5 canvas and really dug the concept. 

I spent some time watching tutorials and learned how to draw on the canvas, as well as core concepts using js.

### Core concepts I touched on during this project:
- canvas context
- drawing on HTML5 canvas
- OOP
- gravity
- friction
- animation
- collision detection
- event handling

The first thing I worked on was a simple program that creates a predetermined number of balls that are all random sizes and colors. The balls fall from the top of the browser and bounce until they slow to a stop.

The second part was the basis for the "canvas mode" of Totes McNotes. It's a simple bit of code that creates squares and allows the user to drag them around in the browser.

I had a ton of fun messing around with this stuff. If you've never used canvas before I recommend giving it a try :)
